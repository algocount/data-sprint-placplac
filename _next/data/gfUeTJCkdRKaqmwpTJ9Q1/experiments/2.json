The choice regarding the metadata was to collect information on the tweets (text, n. of likes and retweets, date, etc.) and include data on the users (author id, eventual id of the replied user, etc.) in order to reconstruct the network of users participating to the debate as well. On a side note, this is not the only type of metadata that one can gather: other research designs could have declared the need to retrieve additional or different metadata, for example, the new &lsquo;entities&rsquo; and &lsquo;context annotations&rsquo; fields made available by the Twitter API n.2. After having obtained the desired corpus of tweets and the related metadata using Python, the last step is to pre-format the text in order to be easily readable and ready for introductory descriptive analyses.
